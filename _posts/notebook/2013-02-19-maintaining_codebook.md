Depending on your main working environnement, you might chose between :

- **R** if you are already familiar with this statistical computing environment and don't want to go to far in raw code
- **Python** if you prefer to start with library and have greater control over your pre-processing workflow and algorithms. Having to learn only one programming language might be a good reason to start with python.
