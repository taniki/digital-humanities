> However, we also need to acknowledge that this necessitates the reassessing of traditions and possible interaction points between the humanities and the digital and allowing change not only in terms of size but also in terms of epistemic texture and institutional focus. An interesting question is whether the recent name change of the Centre for Computing in The Humanities to the Department of Digital Humanities indicates a difference in self-conception and whether it will result in a different institutional position.

modèle big-tent ?

> In politics, a big tent party or catch-all party is a political party seeking to attract people with diverse viewpoints. The party does not require adherence to some ideology as a criterion for membership. Such new joining groups may not influence policy or major party decisions measurably at first. The big tent approach argues against any sort of single-issue litmus tests or ideological rigidity, and advocates multiple ideologies and views within a party

L'arrivée de Yale introduit la question de la marginalité historique des DH américaines. L'entrée d'une Ivy League School peut être ressenti comme une ré-introduction des hiéarchies du champ non-digital.

Conflit et position à l'intérieur de Yale autant que Yale sur le reste du champ social.

stratégie de subversion ou adaptation aux dominations locales. renversement des catégories par la taille et l'improvisation vs inertie de la légitimité.

> One central question is whether the tent can naturally be taken to include critical work construing the digital as an object of inquiry rather than as a tool.

Analyse des Call For Papers

> Arguably, the digital humanities needs to support and allow multiple modes of engagement between the humanities and the digital in order to touch at the heart of the disciplines, maximize points of interaction, tackle large research and methodology challenges, and facilitate deep integration between thinking and making. This perspective would seem to be compatible with the digital humanities as a trading zone and a meeting place. Similarly, the grand challenges identified in the white papers discussed would seem to require consorted efforts. Meeting places can make suche efforts possible. Wheter mostly physical or mostly digital, they can help channel dispersed resources, technologies, and intellectual energy. Firthermore, deep integration of toolmaking and interpretative perspectives requires very different kinds of competencies and work to happen in the same space. It could aslo be argued that there is value to unexpected meeting in creative environments in terms of expanding the digital humanities.

## Why are the digital humanities so white ?

> Much of the work in the digital humanities also proceeded as if technologies from XML to databases were neutral tools.
